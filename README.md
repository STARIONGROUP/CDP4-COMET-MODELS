# CDP4-COMET-MODELS

The CDP4-COMET-MODEL repository contains multiple ECSS-E-TM-10-25 models created using CDP4-COMET.

Each model, or set of models, is contained in a dedicated folder in this repository. The folder structure is as follows:

  - README:  a description of the model
  - zip archive: the ECSS-E-TM-10-25 Annex C.3 zip archive
  - Annex C.3 - Source files: this folder contains the JSON documents that are contained by the ECSS-E-TM-10-25 Annex C.3 zip archive.

The zip archives can be used to:
  - Open the model archive in readonly mode using the CDP4-COMET-IME desktop application
  - Use the model archive to seed a CDP4-COMET-WebServices
